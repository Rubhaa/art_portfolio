            <h5>Rubha Shree S - <span>crazy.doodlerr</span></h5>
              <p>Hey i am rubha. since from the childhood i was very much interested in drawing,But i started to practise it regularly during the lockdown times.

                It started out as therapy and relaxation, but later sparked a desire for a slower, more creative life. I fell madly in love with the pen sketching, doodling, acrylic painting, mandalas,digital art,watercolors. later on i did some customised mobile cover paintings for myself anf for my friends. many of my friends really liked my works this gaves me a better hope to continue further. 
                
                Painting for me is a stimulating challenge, a sensual practice. I often paint silloute,scenary,linearts.Iâ€™m also obsessed with faces and love drawing with oil pastels. later on i tried to recreate many digital art flim covers like a playlists. </p>
